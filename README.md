Group – Matias, Diego, Ethan, Deon, Ryan
Purpose – The proposed project’s purpose is to design and implement a digital system that allows apartment residents to reserve the gym amenity. The goal is to create a user-friendly, efficient, and secure platform that manages gym reservations, ensuring equal access for all residents.
Scope and specifications - We are going to use Ryan’s apartment complex as a model to create a system that would work for those residents. Including a resident and admin login that checks to make sure the user is a resident and a reservation feature that will display to all users if the gym is full or open. It will include a feature where residents can schedule recurring gym times and options a user can choose from allowing them to have a private or public gym experience. We plan to implement a backend system that manages reservations, ensuring no double bookings or conflicts and implement an administrative interface for the property managers and leasing agents to oversee. For our database we want to create a relational database to store the user’s information such as reservation data, gym schedules, and other personal data that the users provide. We also want to conduct unit testing to make sure that all of the features are working as intended and integration testing to ensure the frontend, backend, and our database work together properly.
Languages - Python, pyQt5, html, CSS, Bootstrap5 Frameworks – React or Django Database Set up – MySQL or PostgreSQL IDE – Vscode Version Control – GitHub Cloud – DigitalOcean or AWS
Goals – Design and implement a digital system that can serve as a tool apartment complex’s can utilize to allow residents to schedule private use of the gym amenities offered.
Stretch Goals - If time permits, we want to add onto this reservation system and create it so that residents can also reserve other amenities such as the pool and patio areas. We also would like to try to implement a notification system for users to be reminded of their reservations. If we have time, we would like to try to implement some 3D designs into the interface to make the UI look more professional.
